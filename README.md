# square
Stupid little bot for my Discord server, because fuck your "AI integrated bot" with "Premium features".

This is the developer version - sometimes has minor oopsies in it!

Soon to be packed with features, or something... in a single damn file at the moment. Split feature cogs soon?

# running

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and set the values outlined inside it.

Run `main.py` with `python3` MAKING SURE YOU ARE IN THE DIRECTORY FOR THE SHELL, else it can't find `snips/` or `main.json`, and shit goes downhill QUICK when it can't even access the filesystem.
